# Processing Projects
This repository is a compilation of all the small projects I have done in processing for the past few years. Most of them are math themed. 

## Compiling and running the sketchs
You can use the Processing IDE to load and run the sketch. If you're not looking to leave your terminal, you could always use the 
` processing-java --sketch=\<sketch-path>\ --output=\<output-dir>\ --force --run \`

##Ullam
An implementation of the Ullam Spiral. Quite simple yet creates cool looking patterns based on the distribution of primes in a integer spiral.
