# Processing Projects
This repository is a compilation of all the small projects I have done in processing for the past few years. Most of them are math themed. 

## Compiling and running the sketchs
You can use the Processing IDE to load and run the sketch. If you're not looking to leave your terminal, you could always use the 
` processing-java --sketch=\<sketch-path>\ --output=\<output-dir>\ --force --run \`

# Sketches Index
## Ullam
An implementation of the Ullam Spiral. Quite simple yet creates cool looking patterns based on the distribution of primes in a integer spiral.

## gaussianIntegers
An implementation of the Gaussian Integers. Plot the points whose rounded distance to the origin is prime. 

## Chaos Bits 
Creates interesting patterns using a 2d function on the coordinates of each pixel that outputs an integer, and then checking if a particular bit is set to up in the binary representation of this integer.

## Chaos Logic
Creates fractals using the escape time algorithm with the function representation of paradoxes using real valued logic. 

##biffmap

A bifurcation diagram implementation. Now with another function other than the logistic one !
